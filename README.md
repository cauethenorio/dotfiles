## Installation

On a sparkling fresh installation of macOS:

```bash
sudo softwareupdate -i -a
xcode-select --install
```

The Xcode Command Line Tools includes `git` and `make` (not available on stock macOS). Now there are two options:

1. Install this repo with `curl` available:

```bash
curl -fsSL http://localhost:8000/dotfiles/remote-install.sh | bash
```

This will clone this repo to `~/dev/dotfiles`.

Use the [Makefile](./Makefile) to install everything [listed above](#packages-overview) with a single command as:
```
cd ~/dev/dotfiles
make install
```

Or choose what to install:
```bash
cd ~/dev/dotfiles
make

make list           list all available commands
make install        install everything
